Observations and Trends
1) In Purchasing Analysis (Age) there is an observable trend that the age groups of <10 and 35-39 are both spending more as by the Average Purchase Price. These age groups may be related as a family unit, where parents and kids are both playing the game and making purchases together within the game. As per Age Demographics, these two groups combined only account for about 8% of all players though. An advertising strategy could be aimed at families to purchase more items however that would only appeal to a small group of players.
2) In Purchasing Analysis (Gender) there is an observable trend that both Female and Other gender groups spend more money on average than Males. These gender groups only account for about 16% of overall players. An advertising strategy could be aimed at these gender groups however would only appeal to a small group of players.
3) In Purchasing Analysis (Total) the overall average price spent per item is $3.05. Yet, the most popular items are all priced higher, ranging from $3.22 - $4.61. On analysis of the Top Spenders, it is likely that a group of individuals are contributing to buying the more expensive items and buying more than one expensive item. An effective advertising strategy may be to target more of the overall average price and have a sale on items to boost purchases.
